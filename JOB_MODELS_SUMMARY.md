- `IN_PROGRESS` - Job is being worked on
- `COMPLETED` - Job finished
- `CANCELLED` - Job cancelled
- `ON_HOLD` - Job temporarily paused

### 2. JobUserAssignment Model (Many-to-Many Relationship)
**Table:** `job_user_assignments`

**Fields:**
- `id` (Integer, Primary Key)
- `job_id` (Integer, Foreign Key to jobs, Required) - Job being assigned
- `user_id` (Integer, Foreign Key to users, Required) - User assigned to job
- `assigned_at` (DateTime, Auto-generated) - When assignment was made
- `assigned_by_id` (Integer, Foreign Key to users, Required) - Who made the assignment

- `notes` (Text, Optional) - Assignment notes
- `is_active` (Boolean, Default: True) - Assignment active status

## Relationships

### Job Relationships:
- **topic** → Topic (Many-to-One, Optional)
- **room** → Room (Many-to-One, Optional)
- **property** → Property (Many-to-One, Required)
- **created_by** → User (Many-to-One, Required)
- **user_assignments** → JobUserAssignment (One-to-Many)

### User Relationships (Added):
- **job_assignments** → JobUserAssignment (One-to-Many)
- **created_jobs** → Job (One-to-Many)

### Property, Room, Topic Relationships (Added):
- **jobs** → Job (One-to-Many)

## Database Indexes
Comprehensive indexing for optimal query performance:

### Job Table Indexes:
- `idx_job_status_priority` - For filtering by status and priority
- `idx_job_property_status` - For property-specific job queries
- `idx_job_room_status` - For room-specific job queries
- `idx_job_topic_status` - For topic-specific job queries
- `idx_job_created_by_date` - For creator-based queries
- `idx_job_due_date_status` - For due date and status filtering
- `idx_job_priority_status` - For priority-based filtering

### JobUserAssignment Table Indexes:
- `idx_job_user_assignment_job_user` - For unique job-user combinations
- `idx_job_user_assignment_user_active` - For active user assignments
- `idx_job_user_assignment_assigned_date` - For assignment date queries
- `idx_job_user_assignment_role` - For role-based queries

## API Endpoints

### Job CRUD Operations:
- `POST /jobs/` - Create new job
- `GET /jobs/` - Get jobs with filtering (status, property, room, topic, creator, assigned user)
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}` - Get specific job with assignments
- `PUT /jobs/{job_id}` - Update job (auto-sets started_at/completed_at)
- `DELETE /jobs/{job_id}` - Delete job and assignments

### User Assignment Operations:
- `POST /jobs/{job_id}/assignments` - Assign user to job
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}/assignments` - Get job assignments
- `PUT /jobs/assignments/{assignment_id}` - Update assignment
- `DELETE /jobs/assignments/{assignment_id}` - Remove assignment (soft delete)

### Utility Endpoints:
- `GET /jobs/{job_id}/history` - Get assignment history
- `GET /jobs/user/{user_id}/assigned` - Get user's assigned jobs

## Features Implemented

### 1. Many-to-Many Relationship
- Jobs can have multiple users assigned
- Users can be assigned to multiple jobs
- Assignment tracking with roles and metadata

### 2. Status Management
- Automatic timestamp setting (started_at, completed_at)
- Status-based filtering and queries
- Status transition validation

### 3. Comprehensive Filtering
- Filter jobs by status, property, room, topic, creator
- Filter by assigned users
- Pagination support

### 4. Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints
- Validation of property-room relationships
- Duplicate assignment prevention
- Soft delete for assignments (maintains history)

### 5. Audit Trail
- Assignment history tracking
- Created/updated timestamps
- Assignment metadata (who assigned, when, role, notes)

## Usage Examples

### Create a Job:
```json
POST /jobs/
{
  "title": "Fix HVAC System",
  "description": "Repair broken air conditioning in conference room",
  "property_id": 1,
  "room_id": 5,
  "topic_id": 2,
  "created_by_id": 1,
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "due_date": "2024-08-01T10:00:00Z",
  "estimated_hours": 4
}
```

### Assign User to Job:
```json
POST /jobs/1/assignments
{
  "user_id": 3,
  "assigned_by_id": 1,
  "role_in_job": "TECHNICIAN",
  "notes": "Primary technician for HVAC repair"
}
```

### Get Jobs with Filtering:
```
GET /jobs/?status=IN_PROGRESS&property_id=1&assigned_user_id=3
```

## Migration
- Migration file: `2ce8bc4cb093_add_job_and_jobuserassignment_models_.py`
