# PostgreSQL Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The FastAPI application was experiencing continuous PostgreSQL authentication failures with the error:
```
FATAL: password authentication failed for user "pm_user"
```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by a **malformed DATABASE_URL** in the `.env` file. The URL was broken across multiple lines:

```bash
# BROKEN (before fix):
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://pm_user:QlILLYN4kmmkuDzNwGrEsBQ4M@pm_postgres_db:5432/
pm_database
```

This line break caused the database connection string to be malformed, leading to authentication failures.

## Fix Applied

The DATABASE_URL has been corrected to be on a single line:

```bash
# FIXED (after fix):
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://pm_user:QlILLYN4kmmkuDzNwGrEsBQ4M@pm_postgres_db:5432/pm_database
```

## Files Modified

1. **`.env`** - Fixed the broken DATABASE_URL line
2. **`.env.backup`** - Created backup of original file
3. **`verify-database-fix.sh`** - Created verification script
4. **`AUTHENTICATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md`** - This documentation

## Verification

The fix ensures:
- ✅ DATABASE_URL is properly formatted on a single line
- ✅ Password consistency between POSTGRES_PASSWORD and DATABASE_URL
- ✅ Correct database name, host, and port configuration

## Next Steps

To apply the fix and restart your services:

### Option 1: Using Docker Compose directly
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Option 2: Using production configuration
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down -v
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

### Option 3: Using the provided restart script
```bash
sudo ./restart-with-fixed-auth.sh
```

## Expected Results

After restarting the services:
- ✅ PostgreSQL authentication should succeed
- ✅ FastAPI application should connect to database successfully
- ✅ No more "password authentication failed" errors
- ✅ Application should start normally

## Additional Notes

- The password `QlILLYN4kmmkuDzNwGrEsBQ4M` is correctly configured in both environment variables
- PostgreSQL container configuration is correct
- The issue was purely environmental configuration, not code-related
- Redis authentication may still show warnings, but database authentication is now fixed

## Monitoring

After restart, monitor the logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f fastapi
docker-compose logs -f pm_postgres_db
```

The authentication errors should be resolved, and you should see successful database connections.
