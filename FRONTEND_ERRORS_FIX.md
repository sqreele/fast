# Frontend Errors Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

The frontend was experiencing several critical errors:

### 1. Health Check JSON Parsing Error
```
Health check failed: SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'h', "healthy" is not valid JSON
```
**Root Cause**: The health check endpoint was returning plain text "healthy" instead of JSON, likely due to nginx configuration issues or caching.

### 2. Invalid Address Error
```
0.0.0.0:3000/signin:1 Failed to load resource: net::ERR_ADDRESS_INVALID
```
**Root Cause**: The application was using production environment variables with hardcoded IP addresses instead of localhost for development.

### 3. Failed Fetch Requests
```
POST http://0.0.0.0:3000/signin net::ERR_ADDRESS_INVALID
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Failed to fetch
```
**Root Cause**: Related to the invalid address issue and NextAuth configuration problems.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Environment Configuration Fix
**Files Modified**: `.env`, `docker-compose.yml`

- **Before**: Using production IP `http://206.189.89.239`
- **After**: Using development localhost URLs
- Updated `NEXTAUTH_URL` from production IP to `http://localhost`
- Updated `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` to `http://localhost/api/v1`
- Modified `docker-compose.yml` to use `.env` file instead of hardcoded environment variables

### 2. Health Check Resilience Enhancement
**File Modified**: `frontend/src/app/page.tsx`

- Added robust error handling for health check responses
- Now handles both JSON and plain text responses gracefully
- Added cache-control headers to prevent stale responses
- Added detailed logging for debugging health check issues

**Before**:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/health');
const data = await response.json() as SystemStatus;
```

**After**:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/health', {
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache'
  }
});
const text = await response.text();
if (text.trim() === 'healthy') {
  setSystemStatus({ status: 'healthy' });
} else {
  const data = JSON.parse(text) as SystemStatus;
  setSystemStatus(data);
}
```

### 3. NextAuth Debug Enhancement
**File Modified**: `frontend/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`

- Added comprehensive logging to NextAuth redirect function
- Added debugging to the authorize function
- Enhanced error tracking for authentication issues

### 4. API Error Handling Improvement
**File Modified**: `frontend/src/services/api.ts`

- Enhanced the system health API with better error handling
- Added try-catch blocks for more robust error reporting

## Configuration Verification

### Nginx Configuration
- ✅ `nginx/default.conf` properly proxies `/health` to FastAPI backend
- ✅ No hardcoded health responses in development configuration
- ⚠️ Production config (`nginx.prod.conf`) has hardcoded response but shouldn't be used in development

### Environment Variables
- ✅ `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost`
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost/api/v1`
- ✅ `NODE_ENV=development`

### Docker Compose
- ✅ Frontend service now uses `.env` file
- ✅ Removed hardcoded environment variables

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Container Restart Required
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

### 2. Expected Improvements
- Health check should now work without JSON parsing errors
- No more `0.0.0.0:3000` address errors
- Authentication flow should work properly
- Better error logging in browser console

### 3. Debugging Information
The fixes include enhanced logging that will help identify any remaining issues:
- Health check responses are logged to console
- NextAuth redirect URLs are logged
- Authentication errors are more detailed

## Potential Remaining Issues

1. **Container Configuration**: If containers were built with the wrong environment variables, they need to be rebuilt
2. **Browser Cache**: Clear browser cache if still seeing old errors
3. **Network Issues**: Ensure Docker containers can communicate properly
4. **SSL/TLS**: In development, ensure HTTPS is not being forced

## Next Steps

1. Restart the Docker containers with the new configuration
2. Monitor browser console for the new debugging information
3. Verify that health checks return proper JSON responses
4. Test the authentication flow end-to-end
5. If issues persist, check the new debugging logs for more specific error details
